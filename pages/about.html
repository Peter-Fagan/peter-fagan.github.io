      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I've been working in IT for a long time. I started out studying Electronics Engineering at Uni, but decided I wanted to be more "hands-on" this led me to doing an electronics apprenticeship, mainly doing security and control systems. This led to more into security work and then into IT and networks.</p>
      <p>I have been pretty lucky with my choices, they've allowed me to play with a huge range of technology from satelite phones to VR headsets, as well as the gamut of phones, tablets, high end PCs, Macs, audio and video gear. The one area I had only just touched upon, never fully explored was software. I'd done some basic scripting, played with the Raspberry pi and Arduino, but never really delved too deeply.</p>
      <p>Until now...</p>
      <p>Signing up to General Assemblys Web Development immersive has really opened up endless possibilities. It was hard starting from scratch, but that makes it more satisfying when it works out, from as simple as seeing the correct answer to an equation pop up on the screen to running through a 3D maze you generated.</p>
      <p>So, I'm looking for opportunites to continue learning and expanding my knowledge, to contribute to a team of like minded developers.</p>
