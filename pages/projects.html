    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the projects I have worked on</p>
    <div class="pacmanproject">
      <h4>Pacman clock</h4>
      <p>This was done purely in CSS, I wanted to see what I could do just with CSS shapes</p>

    <div class="amiright">
      <h4>AmIRight</h4>
      <p>This was a group project done with Tomas Haffenden. Using Ruby and Backbone we created a single page polling app. The user creates a question with 2-4 answers which are then presented in a graph</p>

    <div class="chargen">
      <h4>Character Generator</h4>
      <p>Inspired by my years of playing Dungeons and Dragons, I created a character generator. I used Ruby on Rails construct the app and then deployed it with Heroku.</p>

    <div class="mazegen">
      <h4>3D Maze generator</h4>
      <p>This was my final project, to create a randomly generated maze, render it and 3D and make it navigatable by the user. The maze was generated with Javascript and I used Babylon.js to render the world and move the camera</p>
