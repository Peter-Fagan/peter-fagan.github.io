    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the projects I have worked on</p>
    <div class="pacmanproject">
      <h4>Pacman clock</h4>
      <p>This was done purely in CSS, I wanted to see what I could do just with CSS shapes</p>
      <img src="../css/images/Pacman.png" class="pacmanproject">
    </div>
    <div class="amiright">
      <h4>AmIRight</h4>
      <p>This was a group project done with Tomas Haffenden. We used Ruby and Backbone to create a single page polling app which presents the data as a graph at the end</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chargen">
      <h4>Character Generator</h4>
      <p>This project was done to create a Dungeons and Dragons character creator in Ruby on Rails and deployed to Heroku.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mazegen">
      <h4>3D Maze generator</h4>
      <p>This was my final project, to create a randomly generated maze, render it and 3D and make it navigatable by the user. The maze was generated with Javascript and I used Babylon.js to render the world and move the camera</p>
